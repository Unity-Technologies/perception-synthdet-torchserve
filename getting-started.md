## Getting Started
It is highly encouraged that you run TorchServe on a computer with CUDA capability, since prediction times will be unusable when predicting on a CPU (around 3 seconds of inference time). Make sure the latest CUDA drivers are installed. Cloud services such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Amazon-Web-Services-Deep-Learning-AMI-Ubuntu-1604/B077GCH38C) and [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/deeplearning) provide VM images pre-configured to support CUDA. If running in the cloud, it is easiest to start with one of those. For RAM, 16 GB will work fine. Check out our deploy guides for [AWS](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/perception-synthdet-torchserve/wiki/Deploying-a-CUDA-enabled-AWS-VM-Instance) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/perception-synthdet-torchserve/wiki/Deploying-a-CUDA-enabled-GCP-VM-Instance) VM instances.
